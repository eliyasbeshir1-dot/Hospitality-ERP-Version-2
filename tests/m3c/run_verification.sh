# M3-C verification driver: rebuild from empty through every earlier slice, then M3-C.
#
# Chains for the same reason every slice before it does, and for one more of its own. A
# service request is the first thing in this system a guest asks for that is not an
# order: it needs a seated guest from M2-B, a chosen language from M2-C, an order to be
# beside from M3-A and a kitchen already busy from M3-B. A suite that started here would
# be routing requests around a restaurant nobody had proved.
