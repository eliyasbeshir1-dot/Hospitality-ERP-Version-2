# M2-C verification driver: rebuild from empty through every earlier slice, then M2-C.
#
# Chains for the same reason every slice before it does, and for one more. M2-C renders a
# published menu with approved allergen warnings in three languages: that is M2-A's
# translation workflow, M2-B's safety catalog and M1-C's exact money types arriving on a
# screen. A suite that started here would be rendering a database nobody had proved.
