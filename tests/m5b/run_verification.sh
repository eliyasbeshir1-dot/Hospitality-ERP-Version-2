# This asked `command -v python3` and took yes for an answer, then EXPORTED the result —
# so on Windows, where python3 resolves to the Microsoft Store alias in WindowsApps (a
# zero-byte stub that runs nothing), this driver poisoned every driver it chains. The
# chain died at the first migration with the Store's advertisement as its error message,
# and m1a's own correct probe never got to run because PYTHON was already set.

# Sixteen drivers carry the probe below. OP-B copied the weak form, OP-C copied OP-B and
# OP-D copied OP-C — the same inherited-misreading shape as F-OPD-8, in the scripts that
# run the checks rather than in the checks. Every candidate is RUN, not merely located.
